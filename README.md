# Web Frontend Unit Testing Mobiquity Practices

This repository is an example and teaching tool for the
creation of web frontend unit tests with AngularJS (v1).

The point of this repository is not necessarily show how to
create and test an AngularJS app specifically, but to show
examples of tools and processes used for creating unit
tests with web frontend apps.

## Installation

Install nodejs and npm. I recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
or [`asdf`](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) for managing
node version installations, but feel free to install it
from source or use a package manager like `brew`.

Once nodejs is installed, run `npm install` to install the
dependencies for the projects. Now you're ready to start
testing.
