# Web Frontend Unit Testing Mobiquity Practices

This repo contains two separate projects: One written
in React and one written in AngularJS.

## Installation

Install nodejs and npm. I recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
or [`asdf`](https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf) for managing
node version installations, but feel free to install it
from source or use a package manager like `brew`.

Once nodejs is installed, run `npm install` to install the
dependencies for the projects. Now you're ready to start
testing.
